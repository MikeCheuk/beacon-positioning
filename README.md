# Indoor Positioning System for Autonomous Robots 

Objective - To develop a wireless positioning & navigation software for autonomous robots
- Implemented a class Beacon & Kalman filter for information received from Bluetooth beacons
- Modelled a RSSI-distance equation by experimental data with logarithmic regression
- Researched and applied RSSI-based triangulation technique for positioning the robot
- Implemented A* path planning, obstacle sensing & motion control algorithms
